How to Play
1. To start the game each player draws 5 white cards.
2. The admin with the most recent network outage begins by drawing a blue card and reading it out loud.
3. The other players answer the question or fill in the blank by playing their favorite card, face down.
4. The admin shuffles the answers, rereads the question and presents each answer. Then the admin picks the funniest play.
5. The player with the winning card gets an uptime point.
6. Now the next player becomes the admin and everyone else draws back up to 5 white cards.
7. The cake is a lie. Now go ahead, take your time. Your network is probably down already.
