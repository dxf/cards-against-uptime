## Contributing
* Edit cards.txt and add your card as a new line.
* Upload your card to http://mywastedlife.com/CAH/ then generate & add it to the correct folder using the naming scheme of "firsttwowords.png". I realise this is hypocritical because none of the source cards are named like that. Someone please make a PR fixing this. Or I'll do it at some point.
* Submit it as a pull request.
* If it is deemed funny enough, it will get merged.
